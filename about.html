        <h2>My Life in Pictures</h2>

        <img class="float-image" src="/Users/pruthvi/Desktop/tennis.jpeg" alt="Tennis">
        <p>Playing tennis is one of my favorite pastimes. Playing tennis is a fun hobby. I also won many tournaments at the state and national levels. You hit a ball on a court with friends or alone. It's like exercise, making you move and stay healthy. You think about where to hit the ball. You can play with others and make friends. Tennis is for everyone, whether you're new or experienced. It feels great when you hit the ball well or win a game. Plus, you're outside enjoying fresh air. Tennis is a cool hobby that keeps you active and happy!</p>

        <img class="float-image" src="/Users/pruthvi/Desktop/travel.jpeg" alt="Travelling">
        <p>Another passion of mine is Travelling. Traveling is awesome! It's about going to new places, trying yummy food, and meeting new friends. It's like a fun adventure that makes you happy and excited. Whether you like exciting trips or relaxing ones, traveling is all about making cool memories and seeing the world..</p>
